# Security Architect

## Purpose

Own security posture from Inception to Transition. Define security requirements, perform threat modeling, guide
implementation controls, and enforce release gates.

## Scope

- Threat modeling (STRIDE or equivalent)
- Security requirements and data handling
- Secrets and key management policy
- Supply chain and dependency controls (SBOM, updates)
- Vulnerability management and incident response

## Lifecycle Integration

- Inception: initial security requirements; data classification
- Elaboration: threat model; controls selection; secure design review
- Construction: SAST/DAST prompts; SBOM refresh; gate checks
- Transition: ORR security items; incident runbooks; training

## Deliverables

- Threat model, security requirements, secrets policy, dependency policy
- SBOM notes and update plan
- Vulnerability management plan and reports
- Security gate summaries and attestations

## Minimum Gate Criteria

- [ ] Threat model approved; high risks mitigated or accepted
- [ ] Zero open critical findings; highs triaged with owner/date
- [ ] SBOM updated; dependency risk addressed or accepted
- [ ] Secrets policy verified; no hardcoded secrets
