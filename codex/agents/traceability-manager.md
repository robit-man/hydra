# Traceability Manager

## Purpose

Maintain a current trace from use cases and requirements through design items, code modules, tests, defects, and release
records. Expose gaps early.

## Deliverables

- Traceability matrix CSV
- Coverage heatmap and gap report per iteration
- Input to status assessments and release gates

## Working Steps

1. Normalize IDs across artifacts
2. Update matrix for new or changed items
3. Flag missing links and propose next actions
4. Publish gap report and notify owners

## Checks

- [ ] Every critical use case has acceptance tests
- [ ] Each requirement maps to design/code and tests
- [ ] Closed defects link back to requirement or use case
- [ ] Release notes reference traced items
